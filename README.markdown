A plugin for [Yardoc](http://yardoc.org/) that generates documentation for RESTful web services.

Generating Docs
---------------
When using yardoc you ask it to use the "rest" template (the -t option). For example: 

    yardoc '*.rb' -t rest --title "Our App's API"

Writing Comments
----------------
In addition to starting your comment with the normal RDoc description. The following tags are provided:

- @url url. Specifies the URL that the service is accessed from. This tag is compulsory, only classes and methods 
    that include this in their comments are included

- @argument [type] name description. Specifies an argument that is passed to the service. You can specify as 
    many of these as required

- @example_response example. An example of the response that is returned from the service

- @response_field name description. Further specifies the fields that are returned within the response

For example:

    ##
    # Retuns all samples, as XML, for the current user that match the given parameters.
    # 
    # @url
    # [GET] /samples/index.[format]?[arguments]
    # 
    # @argument [String] format Only "xml" is support at this time.

    # @argument ["@assigned"|"@complete"|"!@complete"] search Return jobs that are assigned, complete, or
    #   uncomplete.

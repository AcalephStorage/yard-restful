Sample API
==========
This is a sample API. You should see:

  - This file
  - An index containing one service /sample.
  - That service should contain only two actions: Index, and Create
  - Index should have a description, list of arguments, an example response, and a list of response fields. 
  - Create should have everything that Index has, and also an example request field. 
  - Nothing else should be included because it doesn't have a URL specified.
